        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Blue Planet Trust is a Non Profit Organisation founded in 2021 based in Sangam Vihar, New Delhi, Delhi-110062,  INDIA.
        <br>
        <br>
        Blue Planet Trust is a Registered Organisation with Registration Number: xxxxxxxxx.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are some reasons to establish Blue Planet Trust (NGO). Everyone knows that trees are very important for us and entire Nature but because of growing human population human needs are also growing.
        For fulfill the human needs Trees are being cut.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trees give us almost everythings which we required to live a healthy life in a healthy environment. Tree provides us a disease free environment. Although, trees are taking nothing in return, but still human beings donâ€™t think about it. That's way, we established Blue Planet Trust to protect and replanting the Trees in Urban Colonies.
        <br>
        <br>
        We raise funds for Tree Plantation in Urban Colonies. Our goal is to keep everyone healthy and stay in the Pollution-Free Environment.</p>
