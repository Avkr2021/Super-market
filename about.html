      There are some reasons to establish Blue Planet Trust (NGO). Everyone knows that trees are very important for us and entire Nature but because of growing human population human needs are also growing.

      Trees give us almost everythings which we required to live a healthy life in a healthy environment. Tree provides us a disease free environment. Although, trees are taking nothing in return, but still human beings donâ€™t think about it. That's way, we established Blue Planet Trust to protect and replanting the Trees in Urban Colonies.
